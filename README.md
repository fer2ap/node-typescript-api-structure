Objetctive:

Rocketseat provided the base repo with the basic structure to run a node app using typescript and node.

However, it is also needed to configure an express app and a local connection to a database to create a functional web app based on this stack.

I hope web developers starting their first learning journey on TypeScript and anyone interested in a using TS for their own Web Services can take benefit from this project.

The main tasks to be done are:

 - Configure an Express app;
 - Implement MongoDB connection;
 - Implement Mongoose with the Types and Interfaces required by Typescript;
 - Authentication for the User Collection using JWT
 - Implement an additional collection, other than User to keep as an exemple.
