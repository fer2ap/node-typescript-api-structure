# node-express-mongodb NEMo api
Node.js, ESLint, TypeScript, Jest &amp, Babel + Express, Mongoose

# Introduction:

 Rocketseat provided the base repo with the basic structure to run a node app using typescript and node.

 However, it is also needed to configure an express app and a local connection to a database to create a functional web app based on this stack.

# Objectives:

 Implement a REST API structure using the core technologies from the web and not reliant on frameworks.
 
# Personal objective:
 
 Understand the archtecture of a REST API and improve my personal codebase, aiming the creation of future projects based on this one. 

# Roadmap:

 - Configure an Express app; (OK)
 - Implement MongoDB connection; (OK)
 - Implement Mongoose with the Types and Interfaces required by Typescript; (OK)
 - Authentication for the User Collection using JWT; (OK)
 - Implement an additional collection, other than User to keep as an exemple. (In progress)

 I hope web developers starting their first learning journey on TypeScript and anyone interested in a using TS for their own Web Services can take benefit from this project.

# Future works:

 - Develop the front-end structure to consume this REST API.

# Running this project locally:

 - Setup: Access to a MongoDB at local or remote;
 - Start your MongoDB
 - run "yarn install"
 - run "yarn dev"
 - Open your localhost
 
 # Troubleshooting common problems: 
 
 - If the connection to mongo was done and you have no response at localhost, make sure you are at the correct port.
 You can always change the exposed port on server.ts.
